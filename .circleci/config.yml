Set Up Project
CircleCI helps you ship better code, faster. To kick things off, you'll need to add a config.yml file to your project, and start building. After that, we'll start a new build for you each time someone pushes a new commit.

Select from the following options to generate a sample .yml for your project.

Operating System
 Linux Windows macOS
Language

Next Steps
You're almost there! We're going to walk you through setting up a configuration file, committing it, and turning on our listener so that CircleCI can test your commits.

Want to skip ahead? Jump right into our documentation, set up a .yml file, and kick off your build with the button below.

If you start building before you've added a configuration file, your project will not run. To build your project, add a .circleci/config.yml file. Add a project on CircleCI 2.0.

1.	
Create a folder named .circleci and add a fileconfig.yml (so that the filepath be in .circleci/config.yml).

2.	
Populate the config.yml with the contents of the sample .yml (shown below).


Copy to Clipboard
3.	
Update the sample .yml to reflect your project's configuration.

4.	
Push this change up to GitHub.

5.	
Start building! This will launch your project on CircleCI and make our webhooks listen for updates to your work.
